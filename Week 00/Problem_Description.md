# Week 00: 

> # Linear Search

## Problem Statement: 
Given an array of nonnegative integers, design a linear algorithm and implement it using a program to find whether a given key element is present in the array or not. Also, find the total number of comparisons for each input case. (Time Complexity = O(n), where n is the size of input).


## Input:
* The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then the each test cases follow.
* The first line of each test case contains an integer N (Size of array) and Key (Element to  be searched).
* The second line contains N integers A1,A2,â€¦,AN, where Ai is the i-th element of array.

## Output:
For each test case, print the index of key element if it is present in array, otherwise print -1. Also, print the number of comparisons done to search the element in same line.

## Sample Input:
```
2
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
3 4
1 2 3
```

## Sample Output:
```
2 2
-1 3
```
